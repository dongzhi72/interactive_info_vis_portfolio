          <p>
            Context: This clock is designed for everyday use as an ambient time display that helps users intuitively
              understand the passage of day and night. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>
              <br>
              This clock is especially useful for people who enjoy outdoor activities to plan their hikes, 
              runs, or other activities based on sunrise or sunset times. 
              It can also be beneficial for individuals who want to maintain a healthy circadian rhythm 
              by aligning their daily routines with natural light patterns.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> 
              <br>
              I used color as the primary visual cue, transitioning between warm tones for daytime and cool tones
              for nighttime, inspired by sunrise and sunset. Instead of a sudden switch, the colors gradually
              change to reflect the continuous nature of daylight.<br>
              The clock uses an AM/PM-based circular layout to stay familiar to users who are accustomed to
              traditional 12-hour clocks, while still visually distinguishing day and night. <br>
              Moreover, the switch at 12AM and 12PM ensures there's always continous color without color swich during 
              the transition between AM dial and PM dial, so it's not confusing to users when the clock swithce between AM and PM. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> 
              <br>
              Future versions could enable the user to customize the clock face with different themes or styles, 
              allowing for a more personalized experience. The current time, sunrise/sunset time could also be 
              displayed numerically in the center of the clock for users who prefer a more traditional readout.
            </li>
          </ul>

             to make it more informative and user-friendly.

          <p class="small-note">Water bottle Clock(Timer)</p>
          <p>
            Context: This clock is designed for casual, short-term time tracking with one water bottle represent 1 hr. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>
              <br>
              This sketch visualizes time as a water bottle–inspired timer, designed to encourage hydration and
              healthy habits during outdoor activities like hiking, running, and also suitable for indoor study or work sessions. 
              It's intended for casual, short-term time tracking rather than precise scheduling.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> 
              <br>
              1. I chose a water container metaphor because it is familiar and directly connected to the intended
              behavior of drinking water. Time progression is represented by the rising water level,
              which makes elapsed time easy to perceive at a glance.
              <br>
              2. Hikers can start the timer at the beginning of their hike and use it to track how long they've been active,
              both as a reminder to drink water and as a way to gauge their progress. The visual simplicity of the design 
              was prioritized so the timer feels friendly and 
              motivating rather than technical or stressful.
              <br>
              3. Start, stop, and reset controls are included to allow users to manage their timing sessions easily, 
              making it a practical tool for various activities.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> 
              <br>
              Future version could include a feature to track the numbers of bottles that the users have filled, 
              which can be a fun way to collect honors for exercising and staying hydrated. 
            </li>
          </ul>

            <br>

          <p class="small-note">Four Season Circular clock</p>
          <p>
            Context: This clock is designed as both a functional and informative clock and a seasonal time visualization. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong>
              <br>
              This clock is designed for ambient time display that helps users intuitively understand the 
              passage of seasons and the current time of day. It helps users understand how much of each
              season has passed and how close the next season is, rather than focusing only on exact clock time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> 
              <br>
              I used a circular layout divided into four clearly colored segments to represent the four seasons,
              making seasonal progression immediately visible. It would be easy for users who enjoy outdoor activities 
              to plan their hikes or runs based on the current season.
              <br>
              2. Time units (month, day, hour, and minute, second) are represented by concentric rings with moving ellipses,
              allowing users to read precise time while still perceiving the larger seasonal context.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> 
              <br>
              Future iterations could allow users to upload personal center photos, allowing flexibility. 
              The clock could also incorporate real seasonal markers such as solstices or local climate data.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <figcaption>Step 2 — second layout after peer feedback
            <br>
            I decided to go with circular layout for the clock face and adding background color according to 
            certain season to make the clock more visually appealing and intuitive to users.

            <br>
            The center of the clock is customized with a cute image, making it visually appealing and a inner ring 
            representing seconds is added to make the clock more informative. 
            A moving dot also makes it easier for users to understand the design of the clock and read the time.
